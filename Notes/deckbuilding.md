# Organic Deckbuilding in Magic: The Gathering

## Introduction

### Purpose of the Guide

The purpose of this guide is to provide an in-depth look at an organic and creative approach to deckbuilding in Magic: The Gathering. It aims to help new and experienced players alike understand the principles and processes behind creating fun, interesting, and competitive decks. By documenting this method, the guide serves as both a practical manual for deckbuilding and a blueprint for developing software applications that can mimic this approach.

### Overview of the Deckbuilding Philosophy

This guide is built on a philosophy that values creativity and enjoyment over strict adherence to the metagame. The deckbuilding process is driven by personal inspiration, unique ideas, and the desire to create decks that are enjoyable for both the player and their opponents. The key priorities are:

1. **Fun to Play:** Ensuring that the deck provides an enjoyable experience for all players involved.
2. **Interesting Ideas:** Focusing on unique themes and concepts that make each deck distinctive and engaging.
3. **Competitiveness:** Striving to make the deck powerful enough to hold its own in gameplay while maintaining its thematic integrity.

By following a structured five-stage process—choosing a format, selecting a theme, picking the cards, testing the deck, and revising it—players can develop decks that reflect their personal style and creativity, while also performing effectively in various play environments.

## Chapter 1: Choosing a Format

### Understanding Different Formats

Magic: The Gathering offers a variety of formats, each with its own set of rules and card pools. Understanding these formats is crucial for building a deck that meets the desired criteria and fits the intended play environment.

#### Standard

Standard is a rotating format that includes cards from the most recent sets. It provides a dynamic and evolving metagame, encouraging players to adapt to new cards and strategies. Standard is ideal for those who enjoy keeping up with the latest releases and trends in the game.

#### Historical

Historical (often referred to as Historic) is a non-rotating format available on MTGA. It includes a broader selection of cards from various sets, offering a more stable environment compared to Standard. Historical allows for a greater diversity of strategies and is perfect for players who enjoy using a wider range of cards without the constraints of a rotating format.

#### Brawl/Commander

Brawl and Commander are singleton formats, meaning each deck can have only one copy of each card (excluding basic lands). Brawl is similar to Standard but with a Commander element, while Commander is a non-rotating format with a larger card pool. Both formats emphasize unique and creative deckbuilding, often centered around a legendary creature that serves as the deck’s commander. These formats are excellent for players who enjoy thematic and flavorful gameplay.

### Deciding on a Format

Choosing the right format is an important first step in the deckbuilding process. The decision is influenced by several factors and should align with the preferences of your playgroup.

#### Factors Influencing Format Choice

1. **Playgroup Preferences:** Consider the formats preferred by your regular playgroup. Building decks for the same format ensures that everyone can participate and enjoy the game.
2. **Personal Interests:** Reflect on your own interests and which formats excite you the most. Whether you prefer the dynamic nature of Standard or the expansive card pool of Historical, choose a format that aligns with your enthusiasm.
3. **Challenges and Goals:** Sometimes, specific challenges or personal goals can dictate the format. For example, if you’re aiming to complete daily MTGA challenges, building a Standard-legal deck might be the best approach.

#### Aligning with Playgroup Preferences

Understanding and aligning with your playgroup’s preferences is crucial for a cohesive and enjoyable gameplay experience. If your friends are building Brawl decks, it makes sense to build a Brawl deck as well. Similarly, if your group enjoys casual 60-card decks, aligning your deckbuilding efforts with this preference will lead to more harmonious and fun game sessions. Flexibility and adaptability in choosing formats ensure that you can participate in a variety of play environments while maintaining the spirit of your deckbuilding philosophy.

## Chapter 2: Choosing a Theme

### Sources of Inspiration

Choosing a theme for your deck is a creative and personal process. It sets the foundation for the entire deck and shapes its identity. Here are some common sources of inspiration:

#### Card Interactions

Often, inspiration strikes when you encounter interesting or powerful interactions between specific cards. These interactions can form the core of your deck's strategy, leading you to explore other cards that complement and enhance these synergies.

#### Mechanics and Synergies

Mechanics and synergies within a specific set or color combination can provide a rich source of inspiration. For instance, if you notice a recurring mechanic in a new set that aligns with your playstyle, you can build a deck around that mechanic, focusing on cards that maximize its potential.

#### Personal Ideas and Goals

Sometimes, the best themes come from your own imagination or personal goals. Whether it's a whimsical idea like building a burn deck using unconventional colors or a specific challenge like creating a deck with a particular tribe or strategy, personal ideas can lead to unique and engaging decks.

### Examples of Thematic Decks

To illustrate the process of choosing a theme, let's look at two thematic decks: the Group Hug deck and the Dagger Toes deck.

#### Group Hug Deck

The Group Hug deck is built around the motto "Make love, not war." The primary goal is to prevent damage, destruction, and loss of life, effectively locking down the game. Initially, this deck had no win condition, creating a stalemate. However, to ensure the game could be won and remained fun for all players, a powerful finisher was added. This deck emphasizes the importance of balance between theme and playability.

#### Dagger Toes (Cat Theme)

The Dagger Toes deck is centered entirely around cats. All creature cards are cats, and wherever possible, other cards were chosen to maintain the cat theme. Initially, the deck included only cat-related cards, but support spells were added to enhance functionality. This deck demonstrates how to stay true to a theme while making necessary adjustments for competitive play.

### Balancing Theme and Functionality

Maintaining a balance between theme and functionality is crucial for creating a deck that is both enjoyable and effective. Here are some key considerations:

- **Adhering to the Theme:** Prioritize cards that fit your chosen theme to create a cohesive and immersive deck.
- **Functional Enhancements:** Incorporate versatile and supportive cards that enhance the deck's performance, even if they don't strictly fit the theme. Flexibility is key.
- **Evaluating Performance:** Continuously test and revise your deck to ensure it remains competitive while staying true to its theme. Adjustments may be necessary, but the core theme should always guide your decisions.

By following these guidelines, you can create decks that are not only fun and interesting but also powerful enough to hold their own in various play environments.

## Chapter 3: Choosing the Cards

### Initial Card Selection

Choosing the right cards is a critical step in building a successful deck. This process can be approached in various ways, depending on your goals and the theme of your deck.

#### Key Cards and Synergies

Start by identifying key cards that define your deck’s strategy. These are the cards around which your deck will be built, providing the primary win conditions or essential functions. Look for synergies that enhance these key cards, creating powerful combinations that can turn the tide of the game in your favor.

#### Broad Pool vs. Specific Combinations

Depending on your deckbuilding approach, you may start with a broad pool of cards or focus on specific combinations. If you have a particular card combination or special effect in mind, build around those cards. Alternatively, if you’re working with a color challenge or a new set, gather a broad pool of cards within the required colors and then identify synergies and key cards from that pool.

### Card Mechanics and Versatility

Selecting cards based on their mechanics and versatility is essential for building a flexible and effective deck.

#### Importance of Flexible Options

Versatile cards that offer multiple options or can be used in various situations are highly valuable. These cards provide flexibility, allowing you to adapt to different scenarios during gameplay. For example, a card that lets you choose between dealing damage or gaining life can be more useful than a card with a single, specific effect.

#### Examples of Effective Cards

Examples of versatile cards include:

- **Modal Spells:** Cards like "Cryptic Command" or "Kolaghan's Command" offer multiple effects, allowing you to choose the one that best fits the current situation.
- **Adventure Cards:** Cards from the Throne of Eldraine set that have both an instant/sorcery effect and a creature component, providing two potential uses.
- **Split Cards:** Cards like "Fire // Ice" that provide different effects based on how they are cast, offering greater strategic options.

### Building the Mana Curve

A well-balanced mana curve is crucial for ensuring consistent performance throughout the game.

#### Importance of Mana Curve

The mana curve represents the distribution of cards in your deck based on their mana cost. A balanced mana curve helps you play cards efficiently at each stage of the game, reducing the risk of being stuck with unplayable cards or running out of impactful plays.

#### Ensuring Consistent Performance

To build a consistent mana curve:

1. **Early Game (1-2 Mana):** Include enough low-cost cards to ensure you can make plays in the early turns.
2. **Mid Game (3-5 Mana):** Ensure a strong presence of mid-cost cards that can establish board control and advance your strategy.
3. **Late Game (6+ Mana):** Include a few high-cost cards that can serve as powerful finishers or game-changers.

Regularly review and adjust your mana curve during the revision process to maintain balance and consistency. By paying attention to these details, you can create a deck that performs reliably and adapts to various game situations.

## Chapter 4: Testing the Deck

### Initial Testing with Sparky

Testing your deck is a crucial step in refining its performance and identifying areas for improvement. Starting with initial testing against Sparky, the built-in bot on MTGA, can provide valuable insights.

#### Benefits of Testing Against Bots

Testing against bots like Sparky offers several advantages:
- **Controlled Environment:** Bots provide a predictable and controlled environment, allowing you to focus on understanding how your deck performs without the variability of human opponents.
- **Immediate Feedback:** You can quickly play multiple games, gaining immediate feedback on your deck’s strengths and weaknesses.
- **Safe Experimentation:** It’s a low-stakes way to experiment with different strategies and card combinations, helping you refine your deck before facing human opponents.

#### Identifying Initial Strengths and Weaknesses

During this initial testing phase, pay attention to:
- **Card Performance:** Note which cards consistently perform well and which ones feel underwhelming or situational.
- **Mana Curve Issues:** Observe any issues with your mana curve, such as being unable to play cards on curve or getting stuck with high-cost cards in the early game.
- **Synergy and Combos:** Identify how well your synergies and combos are working in practice. Are they easy to set up? Do they have a significant impact when executed?

### Transitioning to Public Play

Once you’ve refined your deck through initial testing, it’s time to transition to public play against human opponents. This phase is critical for gaining deeper insights into your deck’s performance.

#### Gathering Insights from Human Opponents

Playing against human opponents provides several benefits:
- **Varied Strategies:** Human players use a wide range of strategies and decks, exposing you to different challenges and interactions.
- **Adaptive Playstyles:** Unlike bots, human opponents adapt their playstyle based on the game state and your actions, providing a more dynamic and realistic testing environment.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Each game against a human opponent offers real-time feedback on your deck’s strengths and weaknesses, helping you identify areas for improvement.

#### Evolving the Deck Through Real Games

As you play more games against human opponents, your deck will evolve based on your experiences. Pay attention to:
- **Common Threats:** Identify common threats and strategies used by your opponents. Adjust your deck to better handle these challenges.
- **Effective Cards:** Note which cards consistently perform well and which ones struggle. Consider replacing underperforming cards with more effective alternatives.
- **Overall Strategy:** Evaluate the effectiveness of your overall strategy. Are you achieving your intended goals? Do you need to make significant changes to improve your deck’s performance?

### Iterative Testing and Feedback

Deckbuilding is an iterative process, and continuous testing and feedback are essential for improvement.

#### Continuous Improvement Process

To ensure your deck remains competitive and enjoyable:
- **Regular Revisions:** Regularly revise your deck based on your experiences and feedback. Don’t be afraid to make significant changes if needed.
- **Playtesting Sessions:** Schedule dedicated playtesting sessions with friends or online opponents to gather focused feedback and test specific aspects of your deck.
- **Document Changes:** Keep track of the changes you make to your deck. Use tools like a Git repository to document revisions and analyze the evolution of your deck over time.
- **Stay Flexible:** Stay open to new ideas and strategies. Magic: The Gathering is a dynamic game, and adapting to new cards and strategies is key to long-term success.

By following this iterative testing and feedback process, you can continuously refine your deck, ensuring it remains effective and aligned with your deckbuilding philosophy.

## Chapter 5: Revising the Deck

### Criteria for Revisions

Revising your deck is a crucial step in the deckbuilding process. It involves evaluating your deck's performance and making necessary adjustments to improve its effectiveness and enjoyment.

#### Fun, Interesting Ideas, and Competitiveness

When revising your deck, always keep your core priorities in mind:
- **Fun to Play:** Ensure that your deck is enjoyable for both you and your opponents. If the deck creates a frustrating or uninteresting experience, consider making changes to enhance the fun factor.
- **Interesting Ideas:** Maintain the unique themes and concepts that make your deck stand out. While competitiveness is important, preserving the deck's originality and creativity is key.
- **Competitiveness:** Aim to make your deck as powerful as possible within the constraints of its theme. Balance is important; ensure your deck can hold its own in various play environments.

#### Identifying Non-Performing Cards

During the revision process, identify and address non-performing cards:
- **Evaluate Performance:** Assess each card's performance based on your playtesting experiences. Determine if it contributes to the deck’s overall strategy and effectiveness.
- **Consider Alternatives:** If a card consistently underperforms, consider replacing it with a card that offers similar benefits but performs better in practice.
- **Synergy and Consistency:** Ensure that the replacement card aligns with your deck’s synergies and overall strategy. Aim for consistency and reliability in your deck’s performance.

### Managing the Sideboard

Effective sideboard management is essential for adapting your deck to different matchups and scenarios.

#### Initial Draft and Revisions

When creating your deck, the initial draft typically does not include a sideboard. As you revise and playtest, develop your sideboard by:
- **Adding Removed Cards:** Include cards removed from the main deck during revisions. These cards may still be valuable in specific matchups or situations.
- **Identifying Key Cards:** Add cards that specifically counter common threats or enhance your deck's performance against certain strategies.

#### Full Sideboard Management

Once your sideboard reaches its full capacity, manage it effectively by:
- **Regularly Reviewing:** Regularly review and update your sideboard based on your experiences and the evolving metagame. Remove cards that are no longer effective and add new ones that address current challenges.
- **Balancing Options:** Ensure your sideboard provides a balanced range of options to handle various matchups. Include answers for different types of threats, such as aggro, control, and combo decks.
- **Strategic Adjustments:** Make strategic adjustments to your main deck and sideboard as needed. The sideboard should complement your main deck and provide solutions to its weaknesses.

### Practical Examples

To illustrate the revision process, let's look at two practical examples: revising the Dagger Toes deck and evolving the Group Hug deck.

#### Case Study: Revising Dagger Toes

The Dagger Toes deck, focused on a cat theme, initially included only cat-related cards. Through playtesting, you identified the need for support spells to enhance functionality. Revisions involved:
- **Adding Support Spells:** Incorporating support spells that complemented the cat theme while enhancing the deck’s competitiveness.
- **Balancing Theme and Performance:** Ensuring that the deck remained true to its theme while improving its overall performance.
- **Adjusting Mana Curve:** Revising the mana curve to ensure smooth gameplay and consistent performance.

#### Case Study: Evolving Group Hug

The Group Hug deck, designed to prevent damage and destruction, initially had no win condition. Revisions involved:
- **Adding a Win Condition:** Incorporating a powerful finisher to ensure the game could be won, enhancing the deck’s playability and enjoyment.
- **Maintaining Core Theme:** Preserving the deck’s core theme of preventing harm while making necessary adjustments for competitiveness.
- **Continuous Testing:** Regularly playtesting and revising the deck to ensure it remained effective and enjoyable for all players.

By following these criteria and examples, you can effectively revise your deck to achieve a balance of fun, interesting ideas, and competitiveness. Regular revisions and thoughtful sideboard management will keep your deck adaptable and strong in various play environments.

## Chapter 6: Advanced Techniques

### Handling Major Overhauls

Sometimes, a deck requires significant changes to improve its performance or adapt to new challenges. Major overhauls involve comprehensive adjustments to your deck’s structure and strategy.

#### Adjusting Color Identity and Mana Ratios

One of the most significant changes you can make to a deck is adjusting its color identity and mana ratios:
- **Color Identity:** Reevaluate the colors in your deck to ensure they align with your strategic goals. Consider adding or removing colors to enhance synergy or address weaknesses.
- **Mana Ratios:** Adjust your mana base to reflect changes in color identity. Ensure that your deck has the right balance of mana sources to support your revised color requirements. Use tools like mana calculators to optimize your mana base.

#### Incorporating New Sets and Expansions

As new sets and expansions are released, updating your deck to include powerful new cards can provide a competitive edge:
- **Evaluate New Cards:** Review new cards from the latest sets to identify those that can enhance your deck’s strategy. Look for cards that fit your theme, provide versatile options, or offer strong synergies with existing cards.
- **Integrate and Test:** Incorporate new cards into your deck and test their performance. Ensure that these additions improve your deck without disrupting its overall balance and consistency.
- **Stay Current:** Regularly update your deck with new cards to keep it competitive and aligned with the evolving metagame.

### Tracking Changes and Performance

Effectively tracking changes and performance is essential for ongoing improvement and refinement of your deck.

#### Using Git for Version Control

Using version control systems like Git can help you track changes and document revisions:
- **Repository Setup:** Create a Git repository for your decklists. This allows you to maintain a history of all changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Commit Changes:** Regularly commit changes to your repository with descriptive messages. Document the reasons for each change and the outcomes of playtesting sessions.
- **Branching:** Use branches to experiment with major overhauls or new ideas. This allows you to test significant changes without affecting your main decklist.

#### Practical Tips for Documenting Revisions

Effective documentation helps you understand the evolution of your deck and make informed decisions:
- **Change Logs:** Maintain a change log to document all revisions, including card additions, removals, and adjustments to the mana base. Note the reasons for each change and the results observed during playtesting.
- **Performance Notes:** Keep detailed notes on your deck’s performance in different matchups and play environments. Identify patterns and recurring issues that need addressing.
