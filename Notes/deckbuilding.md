This guide is designed to help you explore the art and science of creating decks that are not only competitive but also deeply enjoyable and reflective of your unique style. Whether you are a seasoned player or new to the game, this guide will provide valuable insights into building decks that bring joy and excitement to every match.

### Purpose of the Guide

The purpose of this guide is to offer a comprehensive look at an organic and creative approach to deckbuilding in Magic: The Gathering. It aims to assist both new and experienced players in understanding the principles and processes behind creating fun, interesting, and competitive decks. By documenting this method, the guide serves as a practical manual for deckbuilding and a blueprint for developing software applications that can mimic this approach.

### Overview of the Deckbuilding Philosophy

This guide is grounded in a philosophy that prioritizes creativity and enjoyment over strict adherence to the metagame. The deckbuilding process is driven by personal inspiration, unique ideas, and the desire to create decks that are enjoyable for both the player and their opponents. The key priorities are:

1. **Fun to Play:** Ensuring that the deck provides an enjoyable experience for all players involved.
2. **Interesting Ideas:** Focusing on unique themes and concepts that make each deck distinctive and engaging.
3. **Competitiveness:** Striving to make the deck powerful enough to hold its own in gameplay while maintaining its thematic integrity.

By following a structured five-stage process—choosing a format, selecting a theme, picking the cards, testing the deck, and revising it—players can develop decks that reflect their personal style and creativity while also performing effectively in various play environments.

## Chapter 1: Choosing a Format

Choosing the right format is the foundational step in your deckbuilding journey. Each format in Magic: The Gathering offers unique rules and card pools, which can significantly influence your deck's construction and strategy. Understanding these formats will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your goals and playgroup preferences.

### Understanding Different Formats

Magic: The Gathering provides a variety of formats, each catering to different playstyles and levels of competitiveness. Let's explore some of the most popular formats:

#### Standard

Standard is a rotating format that includes cards from the most recent sets. This format provides a dynamic and evolving metagame, encouraging players to adapt to new cards and strategies. If you enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest releases and trends in the game, Standard is an ideal choice. It offers a fresh and constantly changing environment that challenges you to innovate and stay competitive.

#### Historical

Historical (often referred to as Historic) is a non-rotating format available on MTGA (Magic: The Gathering Arena). It includes a broader selection of cards from various sets, offering a more stable environment compared to Standard. Historical allows for a greater diversity of strategies, making it perfect for players who enjoy using a wider range of cards without the constraints of a rotating format. This format is excellent for exploring powerful synergies and timeless strategies.

#### Brawl/Commander

Brawl and Commander are singleton formats, meaning each deck can have only one copy of each card (excluding basic lands). Brawl is similar to Standard but incorporates a Commander element, while Commander is a non-rotating format with a larger card pool. Both formats emphasize unique and creative deckbuilding, often centered around a legendary creature that serves as the deck’s commander. These formats are perfect for players who enjoy thematic and flavorful gameplay, offering a rich canvas for storytelling and strategic depth.

### Deciding on a Format

Choosing the right format involves considering several factors, including your personal interests and the preferences of your playgroup. Aligning these elements will ensure a cohesive and enjoyable gameplay experience.

#### Factors Influencing Format Choice

1. **Playgroup Preferences:** Consider the formats preferred by your regular playgroup. Building decks for the same format ensures that everyone can participate and enjoy the game together.
2. **Personal Interests:** Reflect on your own interests and which formats excite you the most. Whether you prefer the dynamic nature of Standard or the expansive card pool of Historical, choose a format that aligns with your enthusiasm.
3. **Challenges and Goals:** Sometimes, specific challenges or personal goals can dictate the format. For example, if you’re aiming to complete daily MTGA challenges, building a Standard-legal deck might be the best approach.

#### Aligning with Playgroup Preferences

Understanding and aligning with your playgroup’s preferences is crucial for a harmonious and enjoyable gameplay experience. If your friends are building Brawl decks, it makes sense to build a Brawl deck as well. Similarly, if your group enjoys casual 60-card decks, aligning your deckbuilding efforts with this preference will lead to more harmonious and fun game sessions. Flexibility and adaptability in choosing formats ensure that you can participate in a variety of play environments while maintaining the spirit of your deckbuilding philosophy.

By carefully considering these factors, you can choose a format that not only suits your personal interests but also enhances the enjoyment and engagement of your entire playgroup. This thoughtful approach sets the stage for a successful and fulfilling deckbuilding experience.

## Chapter 2: Choosing a Theme

Choosing a theme for your deck is a creative and personal process. The theme sets the foundation for your deck and shapes its identity. A well-chosen theme not only makes your deck more enjoyable to play but also enhances its cohesiveness and strategic depth.

### Sources of Inspiration

Inspiration for your deck's theme can come from various sources. Here are some common ones, along with examples to illustrate how these inspirations can be translated into deck themes:

#### Card Interactions

Often, inspiration strikes when you encounter interesting or powerful interactions between specific cards. These interactions can form the core of your deck's strategy.

**Example: The Infinite Combo Deck**
Imagine discovering a powerful combo between two cards that can create an infinite loop, such as "Heliod, Sun-Crowned" and "Walking Ballista." This interaction can inspire a deck focused on assembling and protecting this combo, with supporting cards that help you find and execute the combination effectively.

#### Mechanics and Synergies

Mechanics and synergies within a specific set or color combination can provide a rich source of inspiration. For instance, if you notice a recurring mechanic in a new set that aligns with your playstyle, you can build a deck around that mechanic.

**Example: The Proliferate Deck**
If a new set emphasizes the proliferate mechanic, you might build a deck centered around this theme. Cards like "Atraxa, Praetors' Voice" and "Tezzeret's Gambit" can form the backbone of a proliferate deck, with supporting cards that create and capitalize on various counters.

#### Personal Ideas and Goals

Sometimes, the best themes come from your own imagination or personal goals. Whether it's a whimsical idea or a specific challenge, personal inspirations can lead to unique and engaging decks.

**Example: The Burn Deck with a Twist**
Suppose you want to build a burn deck but with unconventional colors, such as a Blue-Red burn deck. This idea can inspire you to find and include burn spells from both colors, as well as cards that synergize with your burn strategy, like "Thermo-Alchemist" and "Electrostatic Field."

### Examples of Thematic Decks

To further illustrate how themes can be chosen and developed, let's look at two thematic decks: the Group Hug deck and the Dagger Toes deck.

**Group Hug Deck:**
The Group Hug deck is built around the motto "Make love, not war." The primary goal is to prevent damage, destruction, and loss of life, effectively locking down the game. Initially, this deck had no win condition, creating a stalemate. However, to ensure the game could be won and remained fun for all players, a powerful finisher was added. This deck emphasizes the importance of balance between theme and playability.

**Dagger Toes (Cat Theme):**
The Dagger Toes deck is centered entirely around cats. All creature cards are cats, and wherever possible, other cards were chosen to maintain the cat theme. Initially, the deck included only cat-related cards, but support spells were added to enhance functionality. This deck demonstrates how to stay true to a theme while making necessary adjustments for competitive play.

### Balancing Theme and Functionality

Maintaining a balance between theme and functionality is crucial for creating a deck that is both enjoyable and effective. Here are some key considerations:

- **Adhering to the Theme:** Prioritize cards that fit your chosen theme to create a cohesive and immersive deck. The theme should be evident in your card choices and overall strategy.
- **Functional Enhancements:** Incorporate versatile and supportive cards that enhance the deck's performance, even if they don't strictly fit the theme. Flexibility is key. For instance, in the Dagger Toes deck, adding "Swords to Plowshares" helps with removal while maintaining the cat theme.
- **Evaluating Performance:** Continuously test and revise your deck to ensure it remains competitive while staying true to its theme. Adjustments may be necessary, but the core theme should always guide your decisions.

By following these guidelines, you can create decks that are not only fun and interesting but also powerful enough to hold their own in various play environments. This balance will help you achieve a deck that is both thematically rich and strategically sound.

## Chapter 3: Choosing the Cards

Selecting the right cards for your deck is a critical step in building a successful and enjoyable Magic: The Gathering deck. This process involves considering various factors, from ensuring a balanced mana curve to identifying key cards and synergies. Let's delve into the specifics.

### Importance of Mana Curve

A well-balanced mana curve is crucial for ensuring consistent performance throughout the game. The mana curve represents the distribution of cards in your deck based on their mana costs. A balanced mana curve helps you play cards efficiently at each stage of the game, reducing the risk of being stuck with unplayable cards or running out of impactful plays.

**Early Game (1-2 Mana):** Include enough low-cost cards to ensure you can make plays in the early turns. These cards set up your strategy and help you maintain board presence.

**Mid Game (3-5 Mana):** Ensure a strong presence of mid-cost cards that can establish board control and advance your strategy. These cards are often the backbone of your deck, providing significant impact.

**Late Game (6+ Mana):** Include a few high-cost cards that can serve as powerful finishers or game-changers. These cards should provide a significant advantage or a path to victory when played.

Regularly review and adjust your mana curve during the revision process to maintain balance and consistency. By paying attention to these details, you can create a deck that performs reliably and adapts to various game situations.

### Initial Card Selection

Choosing the right cards involves identifying key cards that define your deck's strategy and finding synergies that enhance these key cards. This process can be approached in various ways, depending on your goals and the theme of your deck.

#### Key Cards and Synergies

Start by identifying key cards that define your deck’s strategy. These are the cards around which your deck will be built, providing the primary win conditions or essential functions. Look for synergies that enhance these key cards, creating powerful combinations that can turn the tide of the game in your favor.

**Example: Zombie Tribal Deck**
In a Zombie tribal deck, key cards might include "Liliana, Death's Majesty" and "Lord of the Accursed." Synergistic cards such as "Graveyard Marshal" and "Diregraf Colossus" can support these key cards by producing additional zombies and boosting their power.

#### Broad Pool vs. Specific Combinations

Depending on your deckbuilding approach, you may start with a broad pool of cards or focus on specific combinations. 

**Broad Pool Approach:** If you’re working with a color challenge or a new set, gather a broad pool of cards within the required colors. From this pool, identify synergies and key cards that fit your deck's theme and strategy.

**Specific Combinations Approach:** If you have a particular card combination or special effect in mind, build around those cards. For example, if you're building a deck around the "Aetherworks Marvel" combo, you'll focus on cards that help you generate energy and find the combo pieces quickly.

### Card Mechanics and Versatility

Selecting cards based on their mechanics and versatility is essential for building a flexible and effective deck. Versatile cards that offer multiple options or can be used in various situations are highly valuable. These cards provide flexibility, allowing you to adapt to different scenarios during gameplay.

**Importance of Flexible Options:** Versatile cards that offer multiple options or can be used in various situations are highly valuable. These cards provide flexibility, allowing you to adapt to different scenarios during gameplay.

**Examples of Effective Cards:**
- **Modal Spells:** Cards like "Cryptic Command" or "Kolaghan's Command" offer multiple effects, allowing you to choose the one that best fits the current situation.
- **Adventure Cards:** Cards from the Throne of Eldraine set that have both an instant/sorcery effect and a creature component, providing two potential uses.
- **Split Cards:** Cards like "Fire // Ice" that provide different effects based on how they are cast, offering greater strategic options.

By selecting versatile and synergistic cards, you can create a deck that is both powerful and adaptable, capable of handling a variety of opponents and situations. This thoughtful approach to card selection will enhance your deck's performance and enjoyment.

## Chapter 4: Testing the Deck

## Chapter 5: Revising the Deck

Revising your deck is a crucial step in the deckbuilding process. It involves evaluating your deck's performance and making necessary adjustments to enhance its effectiveness and enjoyment. This chapter will provide criteria for revisions, tips on managing the sideboard, and practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

### Criteria for Revisions

Revisions should be guided by a set of clear criteria to ensure your deck evolves in a balanced and effective manner. Always keep your core priorities in mind:

1. **Fun to Play:** Ensure that your deck is enjoyable for both you and your opponents. If the deck creates a frustrating or uninteresting experience, consider making changes to enhance the fun factor.
2. **Interesting Ideas:** Maintain the unique themes and concepts that make your deck stand out. While competitiveness is important, preserving the deck's originality and creativity is key.
3. **Competitiveness:** Aim to make your deck as powerful as possible within the constraints of its theme. Balance is important; ensure your deck can hold its own in various play environments.

**Identifying Non-Performing Cards:**
- **Evaluate Performance:** Assess each card's performance based on your playtesting experiences. Determine if it contributes to the deck’s overall strategy and effectiveness.
- **Consider Alternatives:** If a card consistently underperforms, consider replacing it with a card that offers similar benefits but performs better in practice.
- **Synergy and Consistency:** Ensure that the replacement card aligns with your deck’s synergies and overall strategy. Aim for consistency and reliability in your deck’s performance.

### Managing the Sideboard

Effective sideboard management is essential for adapting your deck to different matchups and scenarios. The sideboard allows you to swap in cards that better address specific threats or enhance your deck’s performance in certain situations.

**Initial Draft and Revisions:**
When creating your deck, the initial draft typically does not include a sideboard. As you revise and playtest, develop your sideboard by:
- **Adding Removed Cards:** Include cards removed from the main deck during revisions. These cards may still be valuable in specific matchups or situations.
- **Identifying Key Cards:** Add cards that specifically counter common threats or enhance your deck's performance against certain strategies.

**Full Sideboard Management:**
Once your sideboard reaches its full capacity, manage it effectively by:
- **Regularly Reviewing:** Regularly review and update your sideboard based on your experiences and the evolving metagame. Remove cards that are no longer effective and add new ones that address current challenges.
- **Balancing Options:** Ensure your sideboard provides a balanced range of options to handle various matchups. Include answers for different types of threats, such as aggro, control, and combo decks.
- **Strategic Adjustments:** Make strategic adjustments to your main deck and sideboard as needed. The sideboard should complement your main deck and provide solutions to its weaknesses.

### Practical Examples

To illustrate the revision process, let's look at two practical examples: revising the Dagger Toes deck and evolving the Group Hug deck.

**Case Study: Revising Dagger Toes**
The Dagger Toes deck, focused on a cat theme, initially included only cat-related cards. Through playtesting, you identified the need for support spells to enhance functionality. Revisions involved:
- **Adding Support Spells:** Incorporating support spells that complemented the cat theme while enhancing the deck’s competitiveness. For example, adding "Swords to Plowshares" for efficient removal and "Cultivate" for mana ramp.
- **Balancing Theme and Performance:** Ensuring that the deck remained true to its theme while improving its overall performance. This involved finding cat-themed cards that also provided strategic benefits.
- **Adjusting Mana Curve:** Revising the mana curve to ensure smooth gameplay and consistent performance, adding low-cost creatures for early game presence and high-impact cards for the late game.

**Case Study: Evolving Group Hug**
The Group Hug deck, designed to prevent damage and destruction, initially had no win condition. Revisions involved:
- **Adding a Win Condition:** Incorporating a powerful finisher to ensure the game could be won, such as "Approach of the Second Sun" or "Azor's Elocutors."
- **Maintaining Core Theme:** Preserving the deck’s core theme of preventing harm while making necessary adjustments for competitiveness. Adding cards like "Howling Mine" and "Temple Bell" to draw cards and maintain the group hug theme.
- **Continuous Testing:** Regularly playtesting and revising the deck to ensure it remained effective and enjoyable for all players, adjusting based on feedback from various games.

By following these criteria and examples, you can effectively revise your deck to achieve a balance of fun, interesting ideas, and competitiveness. Regular revisions and thoughtful sideboard management will keep your deck adaptable and strong in various play environments.
