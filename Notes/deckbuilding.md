By following a structured five-stage process—choosing a format, selecting a theme, picking the cards, testing the deck, and revising it—players can develop decks that reflect their personal style and creativity while performing effectively in various play environments.

## Chapter 1: Choosing a Format

Choosing the right format is the foundational step in your deckbuilding journey. Each format in _Magic: The Gathering_ offers unique rules and card pools that influence your deck's construction and strategy. Understanding these formats will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your goals and playgroup preferences.

### Understanding Different Formats

_Magic: The Gathering_ provides various formats, each catering to different playstyles and levels of competitiveness. Let's explore some popular formats:

#### Standard

Standard is a rotating format that includes cards from the most recent sets. This format provides a dynamic and evolving metagame, encouraging players to adapt to new cards and strategies. If you enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest releases and trends, Standard is ideal. It offers a fresh and constantly changing environment that challenges you to innovate and stay competitive.

#### Historic

Historic is a non-rotating format available on MTGA (Magic: The Gathering Arena). It includes a broader selection of cards from various sets, offering a more stable environment compared to Standard. Historic allows for greater diversity of strategies, perfect for players who enjoy using a wider range of cards without the constraints of a rotating format. This format is excellent for exploring powerful synergies and timeless strategies.

- **Card Pool:** Historic includes cards from almost all sets available in MTGA, from older sets like _Amonkhet_ to the latest releases. It also includes special anthologies and reprints exclusive to the format.
- **Synergies:** Due to the expansive card pool, Historic supports a wide array of synergies and archetypes. For example, you can build powerful tribal decks like Elves or Goblins, intricate combo decks using cards like _Mizzix's Mastery_, or strong control decks leveraging _Teferi, Hero of Dominaria_.

#### Brawl/Commander

Brawl and Commander are singleton formats, meaning each deck can have only one copy of each card (excluding basic lands). Brawl is similar to Standard but incorporates a Commander element, while Commander is a non-rotating format with a larger card pool. Both formats emphasize unique and creative deckbuilding, often centered around a legendary creature that serves as the deck’s commander. These formats are perfect for players who enjoy thematic and flavorful gameplay, offering a rich canvas for storytelling and strategic depth.

- **Popular Commanders:**
  - **Atraxa, Praetors' Voice:** Known for her versatility, Atraxa can lead decks focused on proliferate, planeswalkers, or +1/+1 counters.
  - **Edgar Markov:** A favorite for Vampire tribal decks, Edgar Markov enables a highly aggressive strategy by creating vampire tokens.
  - **Muldrotha, the Gravetide:** Ideal for graveyard strategies, Muldrotha allows you to play cards from your graveyard, making her a powerful tool for value-driven decks.

### Deciding on a Format

Choosing the right format involves considering several factors, including your personal interests and the preferences of your playgroup. Aligning these elements will ensure a cohesive and enjoyable gameplay experience.

#### Factors Influencing Format Choice

1. **Playgroup Preferences:** Consider the formats preferred by your regular playgroup. Building decks for the same format ensures that everyone can participate and enjoy the game together.
2. **Personal Interests:** Reflect on your own interests and which formats excite you the most. Whether you prefer the dynamic nature of Standard or the expansive card pool of Historic, choose a format that aligns with your enthusiasm.
3. **Challenges and Goals:** Sometimes, specific challenges or personal goals can dictate the format. For example, if you’re aiming to complete daily MTGA challenges, building a Standard-legal deck might be the best approach.

#### Aligning with Playgroup Preferences

Understanding and aligning with your playgroup’s preferences is crucial for a harmonious and enjoyable gameplay experience. If your friends are building Brawl decks, it makes sense to build a Brawl deck as well. Similarly, if your group enjoys casual 60-card decks, aligning your deckbuilding efforts with this preference will lead to more harmonious and fun game sessions. Flexibility and adaptability in choosing formats ensure that you can participate in a variety of play environments while maintaining the spirit of your deckbuilding philosophy.

### Conclusion

By carefully considering these factors, you can choose a format that suits your personal interests and enhances the enjoyment of your entire playgroup. This thoughtful approach sets the stage for a successful and fulfilling deckbuilding experience. Next, we'll explore how to choose a theme for your deck, a crucial step in defining its identity and strategy.

## Chapter 2: Choosing a Theme

Choosing a theme for your deck is a creative and personal process. The theme sets the foundation for your deck and shapes its identity. A well-chosen theme not only makes your deck more enjoyable to play but also enhances its cohesiveness and strategic depth.

### Sources of Inspiration

Inspiration for your deck's theme can come from various sources. Here are some common ones, along with examples to illustrate how these inspirations can be translated into deck themes:

#### Card Interactions

Often, inspiration strikes when you encounter interesting or powerful interactions between specific cards. These interactions can form the core of your deck's strategy.

**Example: The Infinite Combo Deck**

Imagine discovering a powerful combo between _Heliod, Sun-Crowned_ and _Walking Ballista_ that creates an infinite loop. This can inspire a deck focused on assembling and protecting this combo, with supporting cards that help you find and execute the combination effectively.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker + Zealous Conscripts:** This combo creates infinite creature tokens for potential instant win conditions.
- **Pestermite + Splinter Twin:** Another combo that creates infinite tokens for a swift victory.

#### Mechanics and Synergies

Mechanics and synergies within a specific set or color combination can provide a rich source of inspiration. For instance, if a new set emphasizes a mechanic that aligns with your playstyle, you can build a deck around that mechanic.

**Example: The Proliferate Deck**

If a set emphasizes the proliferate mechanic, you might build a deck around this theme. Cards like _Atraxa, Praetors' Voice_ and _Tezzeret's Gambit_ can form the backbone of a proliferate deck, with supporting cards that create and capitalize on various counters.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Adventures from _Throne of Eldraine_:** Cards like _Brazen Borrower_ and _Bonecrusher Giant_ offer both a spell and a creature, providing flexibility and synergy within the same card.
- **Escape from _Theros Beyond Death_:** Building a deck around cards with the escape mechanic, like _Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath_, can focus on graveyard interactions and recursion.

#### Personal Ideas and Goals

Sometimes, the best themes come from your own imagination or personal goals. Whether it's a whimsical idea or a specific challenge, personal inspirations can lead to unique and engaging decks.

**Example: The Burn Deck with a Twist**

Suppose you want to build a burn deck but with unconventional colors, such as a Blue-Red burn deck. This idea can inspire you to find and include burn spells from both colors, as well as cards that synergize with your burn strategy, like _Thermo-Alchemist_ and _Electrostatic Field_.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Life Gain Deck:** Centered around gaining life, using cards like _Ajani's Pridemate_ and _Aetherflux Reservoir_ to turn life gain into a win condition.
- **Mill Deck:** Focused on depleting your opponent's library, using cards like _Fraying Sanity_ and _Maddening Cacophony_.

### Examples of Thematic Decks

To further illustrate how themes can be chosen and developed, let's look at two thematic decks: the Group Hug deck and the Dagger Toes deck.

**Group Hug Deck:**

The Group Hug deck is built around the motto "Make love, not war." The primary goal is to prevent damage, destruction, and loss of life, effectively locking down the game. Initially, this deck had no win condition, creating a stalemate. However, a powerful finisher was added to ensure the game could be won while keeping it fun for all players. This deck emphasizes the importance of balancing theme and playability.

**Dagger Toes (Cat Theme):**

The Dagger Toes deck is centered entirely around cats. All creature cards are cats, and other cards were chosen to maintain the cat theme. Initially, the deck included only cat-related cards, but support spells were added to enhance functionality. This deck demonstrates how to stay true to a theme while making necessary adjustments for competitive play.

### Balancing Theme and Functionality

Maintaining a balance between theme and functionality is crucial for creating a deck that is both enjoyable and effective. Here are some key considerations:

- **Adhering to the Theme:** Prioritize cards that fit your chosen theme to create a cohesive and immersive deck. The theme should be evident in your card choices and overall strategy.
- **Functional Enhancements:** Incorporate versatile and supportive cards that enhance the deck's performance, even if they don't strictly fit the theme. Flexibility is key. For instance, in the Dagger Toes deck, adding _Swords to Plowshares_ helps with removal while maintaining the cat theme.
  - **Examples of Versatile Cards:** Cards like _Cyclonic Rift_ can fit into many themes while providing strong board control, and _Eternal Witness_ offers recursion that benefits most decks without detracting from the main theme.
- **Evaluating Performance:** Continuously test and revise your deck to ensure it remains competitive while staying true to its theme. Adjustments may be necessary, but the core theme should always guide your decisions.
  - **Practical Tips:** Use tools like MTG Arena or playtesting with friends to gather data on your deck’s performance. Keep track of which cards consistently underperform and which synergies are most effective.

### Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can create decks that are not only fun and interesting but also powerful enough to hold their own in various play environments. This balance will help you achieve a deck that is both thematically rich and strategically sound. Next, we will dive into the process of choosing the right cards for your deck, an essential step in bringing your theme to life.

## Chapter 3: Choosing the Cards

Selecting the right cards is critical for building a successful and enjoyable _Magic: The Gathering_ deck. This process involves ensuring a balanced Mana Curve and identifying key cards and synergies.

### Importance of Mana Curve

A well-balanced Mana Curve ensures consistent performance throughout the game. It represents the distribution of cards in your deck based on their mana costs, helping you play cards efficiently at each stage of the game.

**Early Game (1-2 Mana):** Include enough low-cost cards to make plays in the early turns. These cards set up your strategy and help you maintain board presence.

**Mid Game (3-5 Mana):** Ensure a strong presence of mid-cost cards to establish board control and advance your strategy. These cards are often the backbone of your deck, providing significant impact.

**Late Game (6+ Mana):** Include a few high-cost cards as powerful finishers or game-changers. These cards should provide a significant advantage or a path to victory when played.

**Examples of Balanced Mana Curves:**

- **Aggro Deck:** 
  - **1-2 Mana:** 12-16 cards (e.g., _Goblin Guide_, _Zurgo Bellstriker_)
  - **3-4 Mana:** 8-10 cards (e.g., _Lightning Bolt_, _Goblin Chieftain_)
  - **5+ Mana:** 0-2 cards (e.g., _Thundermaw Hellkite_)
  
- **Control Deck:** 
  - **1-2 Mana:** 6-8 cards (e.g., _Opt_, _Counterspell_)
  - **3-4 Mana:** 10-12 cards (e.g., _Supreme Verdict_, _Teferi, Time Raveler_)
  - **5+ Mana:** 6-8 cards (e.g., _Torrential Gearhulk_, _Sphinx's Revelation_)
  
- **Midrange Deck:**
  - **1-2 Mana:** 8-10 cards (e.g., _Llanowar Elves_, _Thoughtseize_)
  - **3-4 Mana:** 10-12 cards (e.g., _Tarmogoyf_, _Liliana of the Veil_)
  - **5+ Mana:** 4-6 cards (e.g., _Siege Rhino_, _Verdurous Gearhulk_)

Regularly review and adjust your Mana Curve to maintain balance and consistency.

### Initial Card Selection

#### Key Cards and Synergies

Start by identifying key cards that define your deck’s strategy. These are the cards around which your deck will be built, providing the primary win conditions or essential functions. Look for synergies that enhance these key cards, creating powerful combinations that can turn the tide of the game in your favor.

**Example: Zombie Tribal Deck**

In a Zombie Tribal Deck, key cards might include _Liliana, Death's Majesty_ and _Lord of the Accursed_. Synergistic cards such as _Graveyard Marshal_ and _Diregraf Colossus_ can support these key cards by producing additional zombies and boosting their power.

**Additional Examples:**

- **Merfolk Tribal Deck:** Key cards like _Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca_ and _Merrow Reejerey_ can be supported by _Silvergill Adept_ and _Mist-Cloaked Herald_ to maximize synergy.
- **Artifact Combo Deck:** Key cards like _Karn, Scion of Urza_ and _Saheeli, Sublime Artificer_ can be supported by _Servo Schematic_ and _Scrap Trawler_ to enhance artifact synergies.

#### Broad Pool vs. Specific Combinations

Depending on your deckbuilding approach, you may start with a broad pool of cards or focus on specific combinations.

**Broad Pool Approach:** If you’re working with a color challenge or a new set, gather a broad pool of cards within the required colors. From this pool, identify synergies and key cards that fit your deck's theme and strategy.

1. **Gather Cards:** Collect a wide range of cards from your chosen colors or set.
2. **Identify Synergies:** Look for common mechanics, creature types, or interactions.
3. **Narrow Down Choices:** Select the most synergistic and impactful cards that fit your theme.

**Specific Combinations Approach:** If you have a particular card combination or special effect in mind, build around those cards. For example, if you're building a deck around the _Aetherworks Marvel_ combo, focus on cards that help you generate energy and find the combo pieces quickly.

1. **Identify Core Combo:** Determine the essential cards for your combo (e.g., _Aetherworks Marvel_ and _Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger_).
2. **Support Cards:** Choose cards that support your combo, like _Servant of the Conduit_ and _Attune with Aether_.
3. **Fill Out the Deck:** Add versatile and synergistic cards to ensure consistency and support your main strategy.

### Card Mechanics and Versatility

Selecting cards based on their mechanics and versatility is essential for building a flexible and effective deck. Versatile cards that offer multiple options or can be used in various situations are highly valuable. These cards provide flexibility, allowing you to adapt to different scenarios during gameplay.

**Examples of Effective Cards:**

- **Modal Spells:** Cards like _Cryptic Command_ or _Kolaghan's Command_ offer multiple effects, allowing you to choose the one that best fits the current situation.
- **Adventure Cards:** Cards from the _Throne of Eldraine_ set that have both an instant/sorcery effect and a creature component, providing two potential uses.
- **Split Cards:** Cards like _Fire // Ice_ that provide different effects based on how they are cast, offering greater strategic options.
- **Planeswalkers:** Versatile Planeswalkers like _Liliana, the Last Hope_ or _Teferi, Hero of Dominaria_ provide multiple abilities that can adapt to various game states.

By selecting versatile and synergistic cards, you can create a deck that is both powerful and adaptable, capable of handling a variety of opponents and situations. This thoughtful approach to card selection will enhance your deck's performance and enjoyment.

### Conclusion

Balance gameplay to ensure it is challenging yet engaging, providing a positive experience regardless of the outcome.

**Innovative Ideas:**

- **Unconventional Themes:** Experiment with themes not commonly seen in the metagame. For example, a "Food Token" deck centered around cards from _Throne of Eldraine_ with _Gilded Goose_ and _Feasting Troll King_ can provide unique interactions.
- **Mechanics Exploration:** Build decks around less popular mechanics. For instance, a "Morph" deck using cards from sets like _Khans of Tarkir_ and _Onslaught_ to surprise opponents with face-down creatures.
- **Crossover Decks:** Create thematic decks that blend different genres or stories, such as a "Superheroes" deck using cards that represent various heroes and their abilities.

**Balanced Gameplay:**

- **Diverse Threats and Answers:** Ensure your deck has a variety of threats and answers to maintain balance. This includes having a mix of creatures, removal spells, and card draw.
- **Consistent Mana Base:** Build a consistent mana base to avoid color screw. Use dual lands, fetch lands, and mana-fixing artifacts to stabilize your mana.
- **Playtesting and Adjustments:** Regularly playtest your deck to identify weaknesses and make adjustments. Gather feedback from different opponents to ensure a well-rounded gameplay experience.

**Community Engagement:**

- **Share Your Decks:** Post your decklists on forums, social media, or dedicated Magic websites like MTGGoldfish or TappedOut to get feedback and inspire others.
- **Join Tournaments:** Participate in local or online tournaments to test your deck in a competitive environment and learn from other players.
- **Collaborate with Friends:** Deckbuilding with friends can lead to new ideas and strategies. Collaborative efforts often result in more refined and creative decks.
